Programming Tasks for Chapter 11
 

In order for the agents to be able to decide on their preferences between different objectives (= proactive goals), we need to implement the different utility functions. We do this by trying to add the functions and variables from the ODD description to the existing code from PT_Template1.

As long as each group only uses the variable names and the utility functions described in the ODD description, it should be possible to merge the different parts into a common version at the end. However, that usually does not work and a better way is for the different groups to talk to each other and to agree on the common list of variables and functions and to coordinate their code. Part of the tasks in the list below is to coordinate the initialization of variables and the implementation of the deliberation functionality.


Task 11.D
Update of the utilities for the different needs of the 'free speech goals'. Test these utilities by programming the deliberation for the goal 'Political' (e.g. holding a speech on Town Square). See the description in section 4.4, 5.3 of the ODD Project description.
