Programming Tasks for Chapter 6
 
Based on the hybrid agent architecture from the previous programming task, we can now start to add some of the proactive goals (objectives) of the agents. Be sure to divide the reactive parts (reacting, walking, arresting, etc.) from the proactive parts (objectives). The active parts in the objectives (like for example 'going to work' or 'going home' should be carried out by the reactive part.

We split up the different objectives among the groups and each group only implements one objective.
