Programming Tasks for Chapter 7
The tasks below integrate a message handling functionality with the hybrid-architecture that we developed so far.

Task 7.7 
A very frustrated citizen-agent has decided that it wants to become political active. It asks its friends if some of them or some of their friends would like to join him at some political event at the 'social house' in town. It tries to 'motivate' its friends (and their friends) by sending alone the own value of fear as an indicator of the upper limit of the anticipated 'danger'. Since the danger will be less if several other participate, the friends with own fears less than double the indicator level will join.

The frustrated citizen waits until it gets at least three affirmations before telling the others to go there 'now'.
